✅ **Market intelligence dashboards** - Investment, M&A, and market size analytics  
✅ **Service pricing benchmarks** - Quote comparison functionality  
✅ **Geographic analysis** - State/province-level company statistics  
✅ **User authentication system** - Ready for production deployment  
✅ **Performance optimization** - Proper indexes for complex filtering queries

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Authentication Status**: User authentication infrastructure is complete but currently disabled in development. See `AUTH.md` for re-enabling instructions.

2. **Equipment Data Structure**: The equipment table uses `technology_id` and `material_id` foreign keys rather than varchar fields as originally planned in `003_restructure_for_equipment_data.sql`. This provides better data integrity.

3. **Market Data**: Demo/seed data can be added using the optional `006_seed_market_demo_data.sql` migration if needed for development.

4. **Performance**: All necessary indexes are in place for efficient filtering operations on the main company search and map views.

## Verification Commands

To verify migration status in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Check all applied migrations
SELECT version, name FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations ORDER BY version;

-- Verify core tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check RLS policies are enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = true;
```
