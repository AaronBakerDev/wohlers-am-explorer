# Supergraphic Usage Guidelines
_Source: ASTM Brand Guidelines v2.6 (2024) — pages 31-35._

## Purpose
- Particle supergraphic conveys technology, motion, and impact; keep it reserved for premier surfaces (hero, cover, title sequences).
- Avoid routine deployment on general marketing promos or dense content areas.

## Approved Application Areas
- Components hub hero banner when introducing a release or roadmap milestone.
- Landing page hero/section openers (dashboard marketing splash, data explorer overview).
- Presentation cover treatments, major report title cards.

## Treatment Options
1. **Gradient Overlay**: Supergraphic over ASTM blue gradient background (as on guide cover).
2. **Photography Mask**: Apply particle mask over approved photography; ensure subjects remain legible.
3. **Motion**: Future video/UI motion usage deferred until creative brief is available.

## Do / Don’t Reminders
- Keep clear space around logo and primary messaging; supergraphic should never obscure wordmark or headings.
- Limit usage to one supergraphic instance per view to prevent visual noise.
- Maintain opacity below 45% when placed over imagery to preserve content clarity.
- Scale particle fields proportionally; avoid stretching or skewing the asset.
- Pair with ASTM blue palette backgrounds; other hues require design approval.

## Implementation Notes
- Store source PNG/SVGs within `docs/astm-brand-guide-images/` and reference by filename to keep asset lineage intact.
- When used in code, wrap hero backgrounds with utility classes that preserve generous padding (e.g., `py-16`) to align with guideline white space.
- Track usage in the components hub documentation so designers can audit placements during reviews.
