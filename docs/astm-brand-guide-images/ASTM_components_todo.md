## ðŸš« Not Needed (Current Plan)
- Interim font bridge (e.g., Work Sans) â€” skipped until Neue Haas Unica license is available.

## ðŸš§ In Progress
1. [ ] Audit remaining shared components for spacing adjustments after typography changes.
   - Notes: verify list/table density and form layouts once designers review.

## â›” Blocked (Dependencies Required / Deferred)
- [ ] Procure web/app license for Neue Haas Unica directly from Monotype (dependency: Branding/Procurement approval).
- [ ] Evaluate long-term ASTM-outlined icon set once schedule allows; short-term plan is to continue with Lucide icons and document styling gaps.
