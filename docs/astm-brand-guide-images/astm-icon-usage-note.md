# Iconography Decision Notes

- ASTM guidelines (page 36) promote sharp, outlined icons with consistent stroke weight.
- Short-term decision: continue using Lucide icon set already bundled in the project.
- Near-term mitigation:
  - Standardize icon size (e.g., 24px) and stroke weight via component wrappers.
  - Limit color usage to ASTM Blue or approved secondary tones for consistency.
- Deferred action: evaluate commissioning or customizing an ASTM-specific set when schedule permits.
