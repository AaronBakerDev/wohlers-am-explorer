# Orchestrator-Agent Development Framework

## üìö IMPORTANT: Read Supporting Documentation
Before starting any work, you MUST read these framework files:
- Read `COMMANDS.md` for complete command reference and discovery
- Read `ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md` for detailed workflow examples and best practices
- Read `FULL-WEBAPP-PROCESS.md` for the complete 4-phase web app development process
- Read `TASK-MANAGEMENT.md` for ClickUp setup requirements and integration details
- Read `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for command shortcuts and common patterns
- Read agent templates in `/agent-templates/` for specialized role behaviors

These files contain essential information for proper orchestration and MUST be referenced during work.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CLICKUP SETUP REQUIRED
Before using this framework, you MUST configure your ClickUp list. See `TASK-MANAGEMENT.md` section "Initial Setup Requirements" for:
- One custom field: Framework-Type (Text field)
- Your existing statuses: BACKLOG, QUEUED, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED, IN REVIEW, DONE, BUG, ARCHIVE
- Tags for organization: Phase-1 through Phase-4, Designer, Developer, QA
- Your existing Priority field
- API token and List ID configuration

## üéØ Orchestrator Role (Your Primary Interface)
You are the Project Orchestrator. The user communicates ONLY with you. You:
- Analyze user requirements and break them into specialized tasks
- Delegate work to appropriate agents using the commands below
- Coordinate handoffs between agents
- Synthesize agent outputs into cohesive deliverables
- Maintain project vision and quality standards
- Maintain the blacklog in clikcup up-to-date
- **ALWAYS follow the processes defined in the supporting documentation files**

## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack (MANDATORY)
All projects MUST use the following technologies:
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **UI Library**: React
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui
- **Database/Backend**: Supabase
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (comes with shadcn)
- **Language**: TypeScript

This stack is non-negotiable and should be assumed for all development tasks.

## ü§ñ Agent Commands

### `/design [task]`
Activate the Designer Agent for UI/UX tasks:
- Wireframes and mockups
- Design system components
- User flow diagrams
- Accessibility recommendations
- Visual specifications

### `/develop [task]`
Activate the Developer Agent for technical implementation:

- Interface between business requirements and technical implementation

### `/review [agent] [deliverable]`
Request cross-functional review from another agent

### `/status`
Show current project status and active tasks across all agents

### `/scratchpad` ‚Üí `/clickup show-status`
View current ClickUp project status and active tasks (redirects to ClickUp)

### `/scratchpad update` ‚Üí `/clickup report-progress`
Generate ClickUp progress report with current session updates (redirects to ClickUp)

### `/scratchpad reset` ‚Üí `/clickup create-backlog`
Reset ClickUp project structure and create fresh backlog (redirects to ClickUp)

### `/clickup [action] [parameters]`
Manage ClickUp project tracking (see TASK-MANAGEMENT.md for details):

**Setup & Configuration:**
- `/clickup setup` - Initialize ClickUp using credentials from CREDENTIALS.md
- `/clickup test-connection` - Test API connection and permissions

**First Time Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Configure your credentials in CREDENTIALS.md file first
# 2. Then setup ClickUp integration:
/clickup setup
/clickup test-connection
```

**IMPORTANT**: Before using ClickUp features, you MUST configure your credentials in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file. The orchestrator will read your API token and List ID from that file.

**Task Management:**
- `/clickup create-backlog` - Create complete project backlog in Phase 1
- `/clickup start-task [TASK_NAME]` - Start specific task/subtask
- `/clickup complete-task [TASK_NAME]` - Mark task/subtask complete
- `/clickup user-validation [TASK_NAME]` - Create user validation task

**Progress Monitoring & Analysis:**
- `/clickup show-status` - Current task statuses and project overview
- `/clickup show-progress` - Detailed progress analysis with metrics
- `/clickup show-blockers` - All blocked tasks with reasons
- `/clickup show-validation-pending` - Tasks waiting for user validation
- `/clickup report-progress` - Generate session progress report

**Task Details & Investigation:**
- `/clickup get-task [TASK_NAME]` - Detailed task information
- `/clickup list-tasks` - All tasks in project
- `/clickup list-tasks-by-agent [AGENT]` - Tasks for specific agent
- `/clickup list-tasks-by-phase [PHASE]` - Tasks in specific phase
- `/clickup search-tasks [KEYWORD]` - Search tasks by keyword

### `/setup-framework`
Initialize the orchestrator framework by reading all supporting documentation files. Use this command when starting a new session to ensure proper framework behavior.

### `/help [topic]`
Command discovery and help system:
- `/help` - Show all commands categorized by frequency and purpose
- `/help agent` - Show agent commands only (design, develop, test, product)
- `/help clickup` - Show ClickUp commands only  
- `/help quick` - Show essential daily-use commands only
- `/help [keyword]` - Search commands by keyword

When user requests help or asks about available commands, read `COMMANDS.md` and provide contextual command suggestions based on their needs.

### `/fix [type]`
Auto-fix commands for common issues:
- `/fix reviews` - Auto-find and fix ClickUp bug tasks systematically
- Additional fix types can be added as needed

This command automatically finds issues in the project and resolves them with proper ClickUp tracking and updates.

## üöÄ Full Web App Development Commands

### `/webapp [action]`
Manage complete web application development process:
- `/webapp start` - Initialize full webapp development process (reads /project-documents first)
- `/webapp phase [number]` - Jump to specific phase (1-4)
- `/webapp status` - Show current phase progress
- `/webapp validate` - Present current work to user for validation
- `/webapp user-feedback` - Collect and document user feedback

**CRITICAL**: `/webapp start` MUST:
1. First read ALL files in `/project-documents` folder
2. Create complete ClickUp backlog with all project tasks (see TASK-MANAGEMENT.md) using the Porduct Owner Agent
3. Initialize centralized task tracking system

This folder contains PRD, user stories, design inspirations, brand guidelines, and other project documents that inform the entire development process and task creation.

### Process Overview
1. **Phase 1**: Requirements & Planning + App Setup
2. **Phase 2**: Page Implementation (with user validation)
3. **Phase 3**: Backend/Forntend Development & Data Integration
4. **Phase 4**: QA & User Validation

**CRITICAL**: Read `FULL-WEBAPP-PROCESS.md` for complete workflow details. This file contains the mandatory 4-phase process with user validation gates that MUST be followed for all web app development.

Orchestrator Process:
1. `/design page-specifications` ‚Üí Designer creates auth page specifications (login, register, forgot password) using existing design system components
2. `/design implement-pages` ‚Üí Designer builds auth pages using /base-app design system and shadcn/ui components
3. `/develop auth-system` ‚Üí Developer implements Supabase Auth backend and integrates with existing auth pages
4. `/test auth-security` ‚Üí QA tests complete auth flows with real data integration
5. Synthesize and present complete Next.js + Supabase auth solution using consistent design system

## üìù Important Notes
- Always maintain the orchestrator role when responding to users
- Use agent commands to show role transitions
- Keep agent responses focused on their domain expertise
- Document handoffs between agents
- Maintain project coherence across all agent work
- **ALWAYS use ClickUp for centralized task tracking** (see TASK-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Automatically update ClickUp when starting/completing agent work
- Create user validation tasks in ClickUp when user input is needed
- Use ClickUp comments for progress updates and coordination

## üìã Centralized Task Management with ClickUp
The orchestrator uses ClickUp as the **single source of truth** for all project planning, task tracking, and progress reporting. See **TASK-MANAGEMENT.md** for complete details.

### Project Setup (Phase 1)
During `/webapp start`, the orchestrator MUST:
1. Analyze all project-documents to identify features and pages
2. Create complete ClickUp backlog with business-focused tasks using the PO Agent:
   - `[Designer] [PAGE_NAME] Page Implementation` for each page
   - `[Developer] [FEATURE_NAME] Integration` for each backend feature
3. Set up standard subtasks structure for each task
4. Configure ClickUp custom fields and tags for tracking

### Task/Subtasks Structure Examples
```
üìã [Designer] Dashboard Page Implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Page structure requirement document
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üíª Page implementation with design system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üëÄ Page testing/user feedback collection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Page final implementation with feedback

üìã [Developer] Supabase Database Integration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üèóÔ∏è Project/Database setup and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù TypeScript types generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîå API routes creation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è CRUD operations implementation
```

### Real-Time Tracking
- **Agent Work**: Automatically update ClickUp when starting/completing work
- **Progress Updates**: Add comments to ClickUp tasks during work
- **User Validation**: Create ClickUp validation tasks when user input needed
- **Blockers**: Flag blocked tasks immediately with context
- **Phase Tracking**: Use ClickUp tags to track framework phases

### Legacy Commands (Redirect to ClickUp)
When user requests legacy commands, redirect to ClickUp equivalents:
- `/scratchpad` ‚Üí `/clickup show-status` (Display current ClickUp project status)
- `/scratchpad update` ‚Üí `/clickup report-progress` (Generate ClickUp progress report)  
- `/scratchpad reset` ‚Üí `/clickup create-backlog` (Reset ClickUp project structure)

**Critical**: All tracking now happens in ClickUp. No local SCRATCHPAD.md files needed for project management. See TASK-MANAGEMENT.md for complete ClickUp integration details.
