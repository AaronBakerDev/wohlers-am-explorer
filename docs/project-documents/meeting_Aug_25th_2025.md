## Summary
Quick pre‑MVP check‑in to align on scheduling, contracting, and immediate next steps before finalizing the MVP. Agreed on a touch‑base this Thursday, a client team presentation next week (Wednesday preferred), and a path to vendor selection by end of next week. Discussed V1 scope handoff and stealth beta strategy aimed at a broader launch around mid‑February.

---

## Key Decisions
- Schedule a short touch‑base this Thursday (same time) — tentative.
- Hold the client team presentation next week on Wednesday (preferred by Vincent).
- Target final presentation/decision on Wednesday, September 3; select vendor by end of that week.
- Begin V1 immediately the following week; adjust scope as needed.
- Pursue stealth beta onboarding on a functional product; broader launch targeted for mid‑February.

---

## Action Items
- Martin: Send calendar invite for Thursday touch‑base; confirm attendance.  
- Martin: Send invite for next week’s Wednesday presentation; include agenda and demo plan.  
- Vincent: Review contract, share comments, and be ready for DocuSign after final validation.  
- Martin: Prepare V1 Scope‑of‑Work draft (main tasks outlined); circulate for review.  
- Aaron: Continue MVP build; compile questions and send by Thursday touch‑base.  

---

## Key Dates
- Thursday (this week): Touch‑base (tentative; same time).  
- Wednesday, September 3: Final presentation to client team; vendor choice by end of week.  
- Week following vendor selection: Kick off V1 build.  
- Mid‑February (target): Broader launch after stealth beta period.

## Risks / Notes
- Requirements are evolving; the team expects iterative shaping — keep questions flowing.  
- V1 timing is tight; scope may need adjustment to hit dates.  
- Stealth approach emphasizes functionality over marketing in near term.

## Cleaned Transcript (condensed)
0:04 — Aaron: How you doing?  
0:05 — Martin: Good — and yourself?  
0:08 — Aaron: Not too bad.  
0:10 — Martin: Thanks for jumping on. Quick catch‑up before you finalize the MVP. Is Vincent joining?  
0:19 — Aaron: I think so — let me check.  
0:28 — Martin: OK, cool.  

0:37 — Martin: He’s still out of office? Becky said tentative.  

40:26 — Martin: Let’s tentatively book something at the same time on Thursday. Also, we should schedule a presentation to my team next week — perhaps Tuesday, September 2. Vincent, would that work?  
40:42 — Vincent: Yes.  
40:43 — Vincent: Thursday I might not be able to join, but we’ll sync internally. Next week is fine.  
40:47 — Martin: For you, mostly Tuesday? I’ll send an email. Same time would work.  
40:51 — Vincent: OK.  
40:57 — Aaron: OK.  

41:07 — Martin: Aaron, would that work?  
41:07 — Aaron: Yep, that works.  
41:10 — Vincent: If we could do Wednesday next week, that’s better — I have the kids Tuesday afternoons.  
41:17 — Martin: Got it. Let’s do Wednesday afternoon, and Thursday for a touch‑base. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to ask questions — no silly questions. Part of the project is helping us structure this; that’s why we like the prototype.  

41:56 — Martin: Keep building — good job so far. Vincent, thanks — super useful. On the contract, ball is in your camp; no rush, check when you’re back.  
42:02 — Vincent: No worries.  
42:04 — Aaron: Thank you.  
42:15 — Martin: Once we have final validation, we can send DocuSign. For V1 there should be another SoW; I started listing main tasks to facilitate this step.  
42:17 — Vincent: Yep.  
42:34 — Martin: If we do the final presentation on September 3, we should pick the vendor by the end of that week. I’ll push for that, so we can start V1 the week after — short but doable.  
42:47 — Vincent: Perfect.  
42:51 — Martin: If we need to adjust V1 scope, we will.  
42:52 — Vincent: Yep.  
42:55 — Vincent: All right.  
42:55 — Martin: If we can onboard beta users with a functional product like what I’m seeing, plus the features discussed, we’ll be good. Strategy is a stealth launch — not advertised — adding more apps/AI and enriching the database so by mid‑February we can charge 5 figures.  
43:38 — Aaron: OK.  
43:39 — Vincent: Understood.  
43:40 — Martin: Thanks everyone — great work.  
43:42 — Vincent: Thanks, Martin.  
43:47 — Aaron: Great.
