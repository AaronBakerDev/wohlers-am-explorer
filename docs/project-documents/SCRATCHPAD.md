# FlowTask MVP - Development Scratchpad

## 📋 Project Overview
**Product**: FlowTask - A Linear-inspired task management web application  
**Vision**: Create a beautifully designed, fast, and intuitive task management application with Linear's design quality  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js + React + shadcn/ui + Supabase + TypeScript (mandatory)  
**Target Users**: Small to medium development teams (5-50 people)

## 📊 REAL CURRENT STATUS
**Current Phase**: Phase 3B - Forms & Data Integration In Progress!  
**MAJOR PROGRESS**: Authentication working, Project creation functional!  
**Last Updated**: January 7, 2025 (6:20 PM)

### ✅ COMPLETED - Backend Infrastructure
- ✅ **Supabase Project**: Real project created (ID: pjsjgyljxcjhxwxdzuwr)
- ✅ **Authentication System**: Login/register pages with email/password + Google OAuth
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Complete schema with projects, tasks, users, comments, labels
- ✅ **Row Level Security**: RLS policies implemented for all tables
- ✅ **Middleware Protection**: Route protection for dashboard vs auth pages
- ✅ **TypeScript Types**: Generated types from Supabase schema
- ✅ **Database Queries**: Complete query functions for CRUD operations
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Dashboard displays user-specific welcome message

### ✅ COMPLETED - Backend Integration
- ✅ **Dashboard Page**: Shows REAL data - projects, tasks, stats from database!
- ✅ **Projects Page**: Displays REAL projects list with stats and progress
- ✅ **Project Creation Form**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL - creates real projects in database
- ✅ **Auto Project Keys**: Generates unique keys like FLOW-001, FLOW-002
- ✅ **Navigation**: All sidebar links work, proper routing implemented
- ✅ **Build Success**: Project builds successfully with backend integration

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Task Management
- 🔄 **Task Creation Form**: Converting to functional form (next task)
- ❌ **Tasks Page**: Still uses static data - needs backend connection
- ❌ **Team Page**: Still uses static data - needs backend connection
- ❌ **Dynamic Routing**: [id] pages need to fetch real data from database
- ❌ **Task Assignment**: Need to connect team members to tasks

### 📝 What's Working Now
1. **User Registration/Login**: Users can create accounts and sign in
2. **Protected Routes**: Dashboard requires authentication
3. **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects with:
   - Auto-generated unique keys (FLOW-001, etc.)
   - Color themes, priority, status settings
   - Due dates and descriptions
   - Automatic owner assignment
4. **Real-time Data**: Dashboard and projects page show actual database content
5. **Professional UI**: Linear-style dark theme maintained throughout
