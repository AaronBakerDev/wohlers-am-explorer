## Dependencies Map

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **US-002** (Database Schema) → **US-001** (Data Import) → All data-dependent features
2. **US-001** (Data Import) → **US-006** (Enhanced Profiles) → **US-009** (Company Comparison)
3. **US-026** (Authentication) → **US-027** (User Profiles) → **US-028** (RBAC) → **US-029** (Premium Features)
4. **US-011** (Market Dashboard) → All market analytics stories
5. **US-021** (Advanced Filters) → **US-022** (Search Suggestions) → **US-024** (Faceted Search)

### Cross-Epic Dependencies:
- All UI stories depend on **US-033** (Mobile Responsive Design)
- All features depend on **US-034** (Performance Optimization) and **US-035** (Error Handling)
- Premium features require **US-028** (RBAC) completion
- Export functionality requires **US-029** (Premium Access) for full capabilities

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Stories:
1. **US-001 (Data Import)** - Risk: Data quality issues
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive validation pipeline, manual review process
2. **US-034 (Performance)** - Risk: Scale-related performance issues
   - **Mitigation:** Load testing, query optimization, caching implementation
3. **US-020 (Dashboard Builder)** - Risk: Complex implementation
   - **Mitigation:** Marked as optional, can be moved to post-MVP

### Timeline Risks:
- **Data Import Delays:** US-001 is on critical path - must complete by Day 4
- **Authentication Issues:** US-026 required for user-specific features
- **Performance Requirements:** US-034 must be ongoing throughout development
