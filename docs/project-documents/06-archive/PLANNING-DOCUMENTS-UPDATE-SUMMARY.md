# Planning Documents Update Summary - August 12, 2025

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

After reviewing the [kickoff_transcript.md](mdc:project-documents/01-planning/kickoff_transcript.md) and [GAP-ANALYSIS.md](mdc:project-documents/01-planning/GAP-ANALYSIS.md), **critical misalignments** were identified between the current planning documents and stakeholder requirements. This document summarizes all updates made to ensure MVP success.

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

### **1. Missing Critical Features**
- **Market Intelligence Dashboard** - Stakeholders explicitly requested interactive charts for market totals and breakdowns
- **Pricing Intelligence Tool** - Core MVP feature for cross-provider quotes benchmark comparison
- **Market Data Tables** - New database schema required for survey/forecast data

### **2. Incorrect Priority Assignment**
- Some P0 stories were actually P1, and vice versa
- Critical stakeholder requirements were not prioritized as P0

### **3. Timeline Mismatch**
- Sprint plan extended into September, but stakeholders expect August 30 delivery
- Week 4 scope was incorrectly planned

### **4. Scope Inconsistency**
- MVP-focused scope document didn't align with actual sprint backlog
- Missing features that stakeholders specifically requested
