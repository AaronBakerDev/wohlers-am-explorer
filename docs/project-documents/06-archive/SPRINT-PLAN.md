## Contingency Plans

### Schedule Risk Mitigation

#### If Behind Schedule (>10% variance)
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Daily capacity reallocation
2. **Scope Adjustment**: Move P2 features to post-MVP
3. **Resource Augmentation**: Extended hours or additional developer
4. **Parallel Development**: Split work streams where possible
5. **Client Communication**: Transparent status updates and alternative plans

#### If Ahead of Schedule
1. **Quality Enhancement**: Additional testing and optimization
2. **Scope Expansion**: Add nice-to-have features from backlog  
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and technical documentation
4. **Future Planning**: Early start on post-MVP features
5. **Buffer Time**: Reserve capacity for unexpected issues

### Technical Risk Contingency

#### Data Import Failures
- **Backup Plan**: Manual data cleaning and re-import procedures
- **Alternative**: Phased import with progressive feature enablement
- **Rollback**: Previous database state with rapid recovery

#### Performance Issues
