**Guide to the "WA digital platform -- Vendors data (MVP)" Spreadsheet**

*What each sheet contains, how to read it, and quick ways to use it*

**Overview**

-   This workbook is a compact database of the additive‑manufacturing
    (AM) market and ecosystem.

-   It combines market-sizing, industry splits, manufacturer and
    service‑bureau directories, price benchmarks, and investment/M&A
    activity.

-   Use it to answer questions like: Which countries or industries drive
    AM revenue? Who makes which printers? Which bureaus have capacity?
    What do jobs cost and how long do they take? Who's raising money or
    getting acquired?

**Sheets and how to read them**

-   AM market revenue 2024 --- Country‑level revenue split across
    segments (Materials; Printers & servicing; Printing services;
    Software). Tip: filter on the right to isolate one segment; USA and
    Germany are typically largest for Software.

-   Total AM market size --- Historic (2014--2024) and forecast (to
    \~2034) revenue with Low/Average/High scenarios, plus segment
    breakouts. Use to see growth paths and compare conservative vs.
    aggressive cases.

-   Revenue by industry 2024 --- End‑use industry shares for All
    materials, Polymer, and Metal. Tips: filter by Region and Material
    to see, e.g., APAC‑Metal vs. EMEA‑Polymer; medical, space,
    automotive are among the top shares.

-   COMPANY -- AM systems mfrs --- Directory of industrial 3D‑printer
    manufacturers with process (e.g., PBF‑LB, DED, Binder‑Jet), material
    format (powder, filament, wire, pellet), material type (metal,
    polymer, ceramic, composite), and country.

-   COMPANY -- Print services global --- Directory of service bureaus
    with fleet details (printer brand/model, count, and whether the
    count is minimum or actual). Use to gauge installed capacity and
    technology mix.

-   Print services Pricing data --- Job‑level quotes: material/process,
    part volume, quantity (1 vs. 1000), manufacturing & shipping cost,
    order/delivery dates, lead time, and country. Includes a scatter
    plot of cost vs. delivery time for a standard part.

-   Fundings and investments --- Funding events (year/month, company,
    country, round, amount, lead investor). Filter to see regional
    trends and active investors.

-   M&A --- Acquisitions with date, buyer, target, country, and deal
    size when known. Use to track consolidation and strategic moves.

-   Company information --- Company directory with website, HQ, and
    ownership/parent relationships. Handy for contact discovery and
    country filters.

-   Company roles --- Maps companies to roles (e.g., Printer
    manufacturer). Designed to expand to other roles (materials,
    software, services).

**What you can do quickly**

-   Market analysis: Compare total market scenarios and segment growth;
    slice 2024 revenue by country/segment or by industry/material.

-   Competitor & partner mapping: Find manufacturers by process/material
    type and region; identify service bureaus with specific printers.

-   Benchmarking: Use Pricing data to compare cost and lead‑time across
    countries, materials, and processes (prototype vs. production
    quantities).

-   Investment intelligence: Track venture rounds and M&A to spot rising
    players, active investors, and consolidation hotspots.

**Tips & filters to try**

-   In "Revenue by industry 2024", toggle Region and Material to
    spotlight niche opportunities (e.g., Metal in APAC healthcare).

-   In "AM market revenue 2024", filter Segment to see which countries
    lead in Software vs. Materials vs. Services.

-   In "Print services Pricing data", filter for 316L or Ti‑6Al‑4V and
    compare 1‑unit vs. 1,000‑unit quotes to see scale effects.

**Notes**

-   Some sheets include filters; if a total looks small, check if a
    segment filter is active.

-   Field names may vary slightly between tabs (e.g., Company vs.
    Supplier). A later clean‑up/normalization pass is planned, but the
    schema is stable for MVP.
