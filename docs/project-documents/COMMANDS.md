### Command Implementation Details

#### `/fix reviews` Implementation

**Purpose**: Automatically finds ClickUp tasks with 'BUG' status and systematically fixes each one with proper ClickUp workflow tracking.

**Prerequisites**:
- ClickUp integration setup (API token in CREDENTIALS.md)
- Standard ClickUp status workflow: `BACKLOG ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí BUG ‚Üí DONE`

**Step-by-Step Flow**:

1. **Fetch Bug Tasks**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: ${CLICKUP_API_TOKEN}" \
     "https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/${CLICKUP_LIST_ID}/task?statuses[]=BUG"
   ```

2. **For Each Bug Task Found**:
   - Set task to `IN PROGRESS` status
   - Add start comment: `"üîß [ORCHESTRATOR] Starting automated bug fix process"`
   - Check for image attachments and download them for analysis
   - Read task description and analyze context
   - Implement the required fix
   - Test the implementation
   - Set task to `DONE` status
   - Add completion comment with testing instructions

3. **Image Analysis Workflow**:
   - Downloads attached screenshots using: `curl -o /tmp/attachment.png "${ATTACHMENT_URL}"`
   - Uses Read tool to view and analyze images
   - Implements fixes based on visual context from screenshots

4. **ClickUp API Calls Used**:
   ```bash
   # Update status
   PUT /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID} {"status": "in progress"}
   
   # Add comments
   POST /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID}/comment {"comment_text": "..."}
   
   # Get task details with attachments
   GET /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID}
   ```

**Example Usage**:
- `/fix reviews` - Fix all bug tasks
- `/fix reviews ui` - Fix only UI-related bugs (if filtering implemented)

**Complete Implementation**: See `TASK-MANAGEMENT.md` section "/fix reviews Command Documentation" for full bash script template.

#### `/clickup` Commands Implementation

**Purpose**: Centralized ClickUp task management and progress tracking.

**Key API Workflows**:

1. **`/clickup show-status`**:
   ```bash
   # Fetch all tasks with details
   GET /api/v2/list/${LIST_ID}/task?include_closed=true&custom_fields=true
   
   # Process and analyze:
   - Total tasks by status (DONE, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED, etc.)
   - Phase distribution using tags (Phase-1, Phase-2, etc.)
   - Agent workload using tags (Designer, Developer, QA)
   - Recent activity from task comments
   ```

2. **`/clickup start-task [NAME]`**:
   ```bash
   # Find task by name
   GET /api/v2/list/${LIST_ID}/task?search=${TASK_NAME}
   
   # Update task status
   PUT /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID} {"status": "in progress"}
   
   # Add start comment
   POST /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID}/comment 
   {"comment_text": "üîÑ [AGENT] Starting work on ${TASK_NAME}"}
   ```

3. **`/clickup create-backlog`**:
   - Reads all files in `/project-documents/` folder
   - Extracts pages/features from PRD and user stories
   - Creates tasks with standard subtask structure
   - Sets up tags, custom fields, and priorities

**Implementation Details**: See `TASK-MANAGEMENT.md` sections for complete API call examples and error handling.

#### `/webapp` Commands Implementation

**Purpose**: 4-phase webapp development process with user validation gates.

**Phase Flow**:

1. **`/webapp start`**:
   - **MUST** read all `/project-documents/` files first
   - Delegates to Product Owner Agent for backlog creation
   - Initializes ClickUp with complete project structure
   - Sets up Phase-1 tags for all created tasks

2. **`/webapp phase [1-4]`**:
   - **Phase 1**: Product Owner creates ClickUp backlog + App setup
   - **Phase 2**: Designer implements pages (‚ö†Ô∏è USER VALIDATION REQUIRED)
   - **Phase 3**: Developer integrates data into existing pages
   - **Phase 4**: QA executes UAT (‚ö†Ô∏è USER VALIDATION REQUIRED)

3. **`/webapp validate`**:
   - Creates user validation tasks in ClickUp
   - Sets tasks to `IN REVIEW` status
   - Assigns to user with notification
   - Blocks dependent tasks until validation complete

**Validation Gates**: Phases 2 and 4 require mandatory user validation before proceeding. Framework automatically creates validation tasks and manages blocker workflow.

**Implementation Details**: See `FULL-WEBAPP-PROCESS.md` for complete 4-phase workflow specifications.

#### Agent Commands Implementation

**Common Pattern for All Agent Commands**:

1. **Find Relevant ClickUp Task**:
   ```bash
   # Search for task by agent and feature name
   GET /api/v2/list/${LIST_ID}/task?search=[AGENT]+${FEATURE_NAME}
   ```

2. **Update Task Progress**:
   ```bash
   # Update subtask status
   PUT /api/v2/task/${SUBTASK_ID} {"status": "in progress"}
   
   # Add agent start comment
   POST /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID}/comment 
   {"comment_text": "üé® [DESIGNER AGENT] Starting ${SUBTASK_NAME}"}
   ```

3. **Complete Work with Updates**:
   ```bash
   # Mark subtask complete
   PUT /api/v2/task/${SUBTASK_ID} {"status": "done"}
   
   # Add completion comment with details
   POST /api/v2/task/${TASK_ID}/comment 
   {"comment_text": "‚úÖ Completed: ${WORK_SUMMARY}"}
   ```

**Agent-Specific Workflows**:
- **Designer**: Guards design system, builds pages using `/base-app/` reference
- **Developer**: Backend-only, never modifies UI, integrates data into existing pages
- **QA**: Browser testing with Playwright MCP, database validation with Supabase MCP
- **Product Owner**: Requirements analysis, comprehensive backlog creation

**Implementation Details**: See agent templates in `/agent-templates/` for complete role specifications.

## üîÑ Orchestrator Decision Flow

**When user makes a request, orchestrator:**

1. **Analyzes Intent** - What does the user want to accomplish?
2. **Checks ClickUp State** - Uses `/clickup show-status` to understand current project state
3. **Plans Execution** - Selects appropriate commands and agent delegation
4. **Executes Systematically** - Runs commands with ClickUp tracking
5. **Reports Results** - Summarizes what was accomplished for the user

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Implement the dashboard page"
‚Üì
Orchestrator: /clickup show-status (check current state)
‚Üì  
Orchestrator: /clickup get-task "Dashboard Page Implementation"
‚Üì
Orchestrator: /design dashboard-page (delegate to Designer Agent)
‚Üì
Designer Agent: Follows agent-templates/designer-prompt.md workflow
‚Üì
Orchestrator: Synthesizes results and reports completion to user
```

## üìÅ Required File Structure
Commands expect this project structure:
```
/project-documents/          # PRD, user stories, requirements
/base-app/                  # Design system reference
/CREDENTIALS.md             # ClickUp API credentials
/CLAUDE.md                  # Framework configuration
/COMMANDS.md               # This file
/agent-templates/           # Agent behavior instructions
```
